We shall solve these problems by hand and also perform random sampling from a defined probability distribution repeatedly to see if our calculated results match the results of random simulations. \n\n## Objectives\nYou will be able to:\n* Use knowledge of conditional probabilities, total probabilities, and the product rule to run random simulations using numpy\n\n## Exercise 1\n### Part 1\n\nSuppose you have two bags of marbles. The first bag contains 6 white marbles and 4 black marbles. The second bag contains 3 white marbles and 7 black marbles. Now suppose you put the two bags in a box. Now if you close your eyes, grab a bag from the box, and then grab a marble from the bag, **what is the probability that it is black**?
